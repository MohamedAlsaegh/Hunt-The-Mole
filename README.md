# Game Strcture and Mechanism

_Figure 1: Hunt The Mole game wireframe_

- The main ideas:

  The player hits the mole, which randomly moves between holes. Each successful hit earns points. The game continues indefinitely (hypothetically) until the player either loses or resets the game.

- Heart mechanism :

  Every time the player misses (clicks without scoring), they lose one heart. The player starts with 3 hearts, and the game ends when all hearts are lost.

- Reset button : The reset button serves two purposes:

  1. Restart the game after losing.

  2. Allow the player to reset the game at any time.
     Pressing reset restores the hearts back to 3 and resets the score to zero.
